1) Create a procedure to discover hardware devices
2) the hardware discovery procedure will write a file named devices.conf to be located under /opt/scripta/etc
3) the hardware device procedure will run on schedule (every 10 sec. for example) and will update the devices.conf file
4) The devices.conf file is written in json format and should contain a vector of records like the one in the example below:

{
"devices" : [
    { 
    	"exec-name":"<nameOfTheExecutable1>",
    	"device-type":"GC-3355v1"
	"devName":"/dev/ttyUSB1",
    	"api-listen": true,
    	"api-port": "4028",
    	"expiry": "120",
    	"hotplug": "5",
    	"log": "5",
    	"no-pool-disable": true,
    	"queue": "1",
    	"scan-time": "30",
    	"scrypt": true,
    	"shares": "0",
    	"pools": [
       		{
            	"url": "stratum tcp:\/\/global.wemineltc.com:3335",
            	"user": "drfranz.gs",
            	"pass": "gs"
        	}
    	]
    },
    { 
    	"exec-name":"<nameOfTheExecutable2>",
	"device-type":"DualMiner"
    	"devName":"/dev/ttyUSB0",
    	"api-listen": true,
    	"api-port": "4029",
    	"expiry": "120",
    	"hotplug": "5",
    	"log": "5",
    	"no-pool-disable": true,
    	"queue": "1",
    	"scan-time": "30",
    	"scrypt": true,
    	"shares": "0",
    	"pools": [
       		{
            	"url": "stratum tcp:\/\/global.wemineltc.com:3335",
            	"user": "drfranz.gs2",
            	"pass": "gs2"
        	}
    	]
    }
 ]
}

5) the purpose of this file is to enable to freely associate each device to an executable and a set of parameters, 
along with the pools the dev should mine on. In the initial phase, for sake of semplicity, we could assume all pools 
to be the same (including worker name and pw) and focus on the various aspect of managing different executables/groups 
of parameters. This is a flexible solution able to manage quick integration of new hardware using custom-made miner 
software (for exmaple a patched cgminer) and, to support, when possible, a single miner software scenario.
